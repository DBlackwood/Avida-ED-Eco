# A \"name-set\" are the set of statements that all use the same resource name. For Avida-ED the REACTION name should match as well. 
# name and the reaction name should match as well. Each nam set may contatin:
#    RESCOURCE   
#      - must be the first line of the name-set for Avida-ED
#      - describes the resouce 
#      - defines boundaries for inflow and outflow 
#      - sets diffusion on or off 
#      - needed for all sub-region resources 
#      - grid position is based on two dimensional representation where (0,0) is uppper left corner 
#    CELL 
#      - requires a RESOURCE statement 
#      - defines boundaries for initial so needed for Finite
#      - also used to define gradient resources 
#      - may have zero or more CELL statements in each name-set 
#      - are not named but must have matcing resource name 
#      - grid position are based on a one dimensional array from 0 to world size - 1 
#      - 
#    REACTION 
#      - needed for there to be any effect on Avians
#      - defines tsk needed and the effect 
#      - no matching RESOURCE statement:
#      - - when there is no resouce name is stated or there is no matching RESOURCE statement.
#      - - must be none or infinite;
#      - - must be glogal 
#      - - could act as \"none\" even for  global/local or a subregion even if not technically correct
#      - matching RESOURE statement found 
#      - - can be global or local; can be any resource option 
#      - can be either global or finite (grid) if a RESOURCE is specieifed. 
#
# Summary: There must be a REACTION STATEMENT to effect an avidian
#    RESOURCE statement must be first line for each name-set if there is a RESOURCE statement
